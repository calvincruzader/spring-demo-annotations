annotations notes
- When autowiring, doesn't have to be an interface, you can use classes as well just fine.
- Right when you initialize an ClassPathXmlApplicationContext variable, Spring will do its component scanning and store 
(what exactly? a collection of beans? and store them )

general notes learned today: 
what does it mean to serialize an object? to serialize the object means to convert it into a byte stream

What 3 properties comprise a JavaBean:
- all properites are private 
- a public no-arg constructor is provided
- implements serializable    <- (its objects can be put into bytestreams!)

What does it mean for a class in Java to implement Serializable? 
- it means objects of that class are serializable/can be serialized/ can be written into streams, thus to files, object databases, and ANYTHING really

What does it mean to be a JavaBean vs another class? 
- a class defines a JavaBean if it follows the standards
